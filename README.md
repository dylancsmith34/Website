A workspace to create Merlot and a Masterpeice's new website

Website Framework:

styles.css - All CSS will go here. Good documentation is important. To start a comment in CSS, use a #, it should be on its own line, just before any section of styling.

index.php - This is the landing page.

header.php - This chunk of code will be present on many of our pages, it is the header.

footer.php - This chunk of code will be present on many of our pages, it is the footer.

functions.js - Javascript functions will go in the API.js file. Again, it is very important to include very good documentation here.

config.php - This will contain the credentials necessary to access the the database. They are contained here so that we do not need to include them at the top of every page, we can just reference this code.
